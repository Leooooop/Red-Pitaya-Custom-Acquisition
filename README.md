# Red Pitaya Custom FPGA Project

**Author:** Ponsin LÃ©o  
**Date:** 2025  

This repository contains a custom Red Pitaya FPGA design with SCPI server/client tools and a Vivado project.

## Folder structure

- **old_files/**  
  Legacy files that are no longer used in the final version, but were useful during development.

- **scpi_client/**  
  Python scripts running on the **PC** to communicate with the Red Pitaya over SCPI (e.g. realtime viewer, trigger control).

- **scpi_server/**  
  C sources running on the **Red Pitaya** (Linux user space) that implement a minimal SCPI server (`*IDN?`, `scopech1?`, `TRIG:LEV`, etc.).

- **redpitaya_custom_fpga.xpr**  
  Vivado 2020.1 project file.  
  Unzip / open it directly in Vivado to rebuild or modify the FPGA design.

- **upload_bit**  
  Script to upload the bitstream generated by Vivado into the Red Pitaya.  
  It automatically searches inside the Vivado project folder for the latest `.bit` file, convert it to `.bin` and uploads it to `/opt/redpitaya/fpga`.

## Important note (Red Pitaya)

Before running `upload_bit`, make sure to **remount `/opt/redpitaya` in read/write mode**, because after a reset the Red Pitaya mounts these folders read-only:

```bash
mount -o remount,rw /opt/redpitaya
